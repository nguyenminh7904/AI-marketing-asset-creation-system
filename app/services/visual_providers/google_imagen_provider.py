Important limitation:
Google Imagen through the Gemini API is used here as an input-aware concept generator, not pixel-level image editing.
The uploaded product/reference images were summarized by a vision model, then passed into this prompt.

Variant instruction:
Create variant {variant_index + 1} with a distinct but commercially usable composition.

Quality requirements:
- Realistic luxury product photography.
- Clear product focus.
- Premium lighting and believable shadows.
- Clean ecommerce/social commerce composition.
- No people unless the prompt explicitly asks for a person.
- Avoid fake logos, misleading brand claims, or unreadable text.
