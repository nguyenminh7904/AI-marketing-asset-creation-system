# AI Product Studio Update Summary

This document summarizes the main product, backend, database, UI, provider, and evaluation updates made to AI Product Studio.

## 1. Product Direction

```text
app/core/pipeline.py
app/core/schemas.py
app/services/scoring_service.py
app/services/llm_service.py
app/services/llm_providers/gemini_text_provider.py

## 7. Review Workflow Updates

Updated workflow statuses:

```text
generated
pending_review
needs_revision
revised
approved
rejected
exported
failed
```

Human-in-the-loop review now supports:

- Editing generated content.
- Selecting the best visual variant manually.
- Saving reviewer notes.
- Marking assets as needing revision.
- Approving assets.
- Exporting final campaign packages.
- Tracking events in an audit trail.

## 8. Export Updates

Updated file:

```text
app/services/export_service.py
```

Export ZIP now includes:

- Best image.
- All variants.
- Original product image.
- Reference image when provided.
- Campaign brief JSON.
- Asset metadata JSON.
- Quality report JSON.
- Caption text.
- Channel-specific content files.
- Reviewer note when available.

## 9. Provider Handling Updates

Updated files:

```text
app/services/visual_service.py
app/config.py
.env.example
README.md
```

Provider improvements:

- Added provider circuit breaker for the current generation run.
- If a provider fails with quota, billing, authentication, or rate-limit errors, the app skips that provider for the remaining variants in the same run.
- Added safer provider error logging.
- Added configuration warnings for likely wrong provider setup.
- Fixed invalid Gemini image model name.

Current Gemini image model:

```env
GEMINI_IMAGE_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash-image
GEMINI_IMAGE_MODEL_CHAIN=gemini-2.5-flash-image,gemini-3-pro-image-preview
```

Known current Gemini image model options:

```text
gemini-2.5-flash-image
gemini-3-pro-image-preview
```

The app now supports `GEMINI_IMAGE_MODEL_CHAIN`, so the `gemini_image` provider can try more than one Gemini image model before falling back to the next visual provider.

## 10. Evaluation Framework

Added file:

```text
docs/evaluation_framework.md
```

Added an academic/product evaluation framework for luxury resale campaigns.

Evaluation criteria:

| Criterion | Weight |
| --- | ---: |
| Product identity preservation | 20% |
| Luxury visual quality | 20% |
| Marketing message fit | 15% |
| Commercial readiness | 15% |
| Human review usefulness | 10% |
| Trust and compliance | 10% |
| System reliability | 10% |

The Streamlit app also includes an Evaluation tab with a weighted 100-point scoring tool.

## 11. Environment Guidance

For real image generation with Gemini and Replicate:

```env
VISUAL_PROVIDER_CHAIN=gemini_image,replicate_flux,mock
LLM_PROVIDER_CHAIN=gemini_text,mock
```

For Replicate FLUX only:

```env
VISUAL_PROVIDER_CHAIN=replicate_flux,mock
LLM_PROVIDER_CHAIN=gemini_text,mock
```

For clean local/classroom testing without paid image calls:

```env
VISUAL_PROVIDER_CHAIN=mock
LLM_PROVIDER_CHAIN=gemini_text,mock
```

## 12. Gemini 429 Confirmation

Yes, the local logs confirm that the Gemini image provider returned:

```text
provider=gemini_image
ClientError: 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
```

This appeared in multiple runs, including:

| Time | Asset ID | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-05-15 19:26:58 | `38bcd812-e389-4293-a203-edb85e85a4b1` | `gemini_image` failed with `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`; app fell back to mock image generation |
| 2026-05-15 19:36:54 | `ee322f0b-11da-4c66-bd4d-f8fcdb9eee4f` | `gemini_image` failed with `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`; app fell back to mock image generation |

Interpretation:

- The request reached the Gemini API.
- Gemini rejected the image-generation request with HTTP `429`.
- `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` means the configured Google project/key has exhausted quota, rate limit, or billing allowance for that model.
- This is not the same as a frontend bug.
- This is not the same as Replicate failing.

In the latest logged run:

```text
gemini_image -> 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
replicate_flux -> 402 Insufficient credit
mock -> success
gemini_text -> success
```

So the app completed successfully, but the generated visual came from the mock fallback, while the marketing text came from Gemini Text.

## 13. Remaining Production Gaps

The app is much stronger than a demo now, but these are still recommended before real production deployment:

- Add user authentication.
- Add Alembic migrations instead of lightweight SQLite migration helpers.
- Move from SQLite to PostgreSQL for multi-user use.
- Add background job queue for long image generation calls.
- Add real object storage such as S3 or Cloud Storage.
- Add automated provider health checks.
- Add formal CLIP/FID/LPIPS or human-evaluation experiments if needed for a stronger academic thesis.
- Add billing/cost tracking per generation.
- Add publishing integrations such as Shopify, Instagram, or CMS export.
